1) Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Ans.

HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication. By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user. There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.




HTTP/1.1

It works on the textual format.
There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
It compresses data by itself.

HTTP/2

It works on the binary protocol.
It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests. 
It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 
It uses HPACK for data compression.



2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript

  An object is a group of data that is stored as a series of name value pairs encapsulated in one entity.

in JavaScript everything is a object
